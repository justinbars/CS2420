{"name":"Cs2420","tagline":"This repository is my work done in my Data Structures and Algorithms class at the University of Utah","body":"### Welcome to my CS 2420 Repository.\r\nThis repository contains all my assignments from my data structures and algorithms class. In each folder is the pdf with the description of the assignment and the codes that I submitted.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd justinbars/CS2420\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n### Assignment 1\r\nThis assignment was designed to be a Java review. We were required to create two classes, one class that has the methods for operations on the matrices, and another class to test the code.\r\n\r\n### Assignment 2\r\nFor this assignment we completed a partially written code that implements a data structure that keeps track of book object and outputs arrays depending on the users specifications\r\n\r\n### Assignment 3\r\nFor this assignment we made our own ArrayCollection data structure.\r\n\r\n### Assignment 4\r\nIn this assignment we practiced implementing a variety of sorting algorithms on an array.\r\n\r\n### Assignment 6\r\nFor this assignment we made our own LinkedList data structure.\r\n\r\n### Assignment 7\r\nIn this assignment we got practice using stacks and queues, we made a program that checked to see if a program contained balanced symbols, i.e. an opening { contains a closing }\r\n\r\n### Assignment 8\r\nThis assignment taught us about Binary Trees. We had to implement a sorted-binary tree of dictionary words and search through it to see if words provided were spelled correctly.\r\n\r\n### Assignment 9\r\nThis assignment combined a variety of elements to solve a maze. We had to implement linked-list, arrays, and queues to find the shortest path between two points in a 2d array.\r\n\r\n### Assignment 10\r\nThis assignment had us construct a hash table and practice quad-probing and chaining-tables.\r\n\r\n### Assignment 11\r\nThis assignment gave us practice with binary-heaps as we were required to implement the interface.\r\n\r\n### Assignment 12\r\nThis assignment made decompress and compress a file using huffman's algorithm.\r\n\r\n### Extra Credit\r\nThis extra credit assignment brushed up on multi-threading and its uses.\r\n\r\n### Final Project\r\nFor our final project we had to decide our own data structures and create a random-phrase generator using a specific syntax provided.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
