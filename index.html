<p>This repository contains all my assignments from my data structures and algorithms class. In each folder is the pdf with the description of the assignment and the codes that I submitted.</p>

<h3>
<a name="assignment-1" class="anchor" href="#assignment-1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment 1</h3>

<p>This assignment was designed to be a Java review. We were required to create two classes, one class that has the methods for operations on the matrices, and another class to test the code.</p>

<h3>
<a name="assignment-2" class="anchor" href="#assignment-2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment 2</h3>

<p>For this assignment we completed a partially written code that implements a data structure that keeps track of book object and outputs arrays depending on the users specifications</p>

<h3>
<a name="assignment-3" class="anchor" href="#assignment-3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment 3</h3>

<p>For this assignment we made our own ArrayCollection data structure.</p>

<h3>
<a name="assignment-4" class="anchor" href="#assignment-4"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment 4</h3>

<p>In this assignment we practiced implementing a variety of sorting algorithms on an array.</p>

<h3>
<a name="assignment-6" class="anchor" href="#assignment-6"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment 6</h3>

<p>For this assignment we made our own LinkedList data structure.</p>

<h3>
<a name="assignment-7" class="anchor" href="#assignment-7"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment 7</h3>

<p>In this assignment we got practice using stacks and queues, we made a program that checked to see if a program contained balanced symbols, i.e. an opening { contains a closing }</p>

<h3>
<a name="assignment-8" class="anchor" href="#assignment-8"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment 8</h3>

<p>This assignment taught us about Binary Trees. We had to implement a sorted-binary tree of dictionary words and search through it to see if words provided were spelled correctly.</p>

<h3>
<a name="assignment-9" class="anchor" href="#assignment-9"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment 9</h3>

<p>This assignment combined a variety of elements to solve a maze. We had to implement linked-list, arrays, and queues to find the shortest path between two points in a 2d array.</p>

<h3>
<a name="assignment-10" class="anchor" href="#assignment-10"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment 10</h3>

<p>This assignment had us construct a hash table and practice quad-probing and chaining-tables.</p>

<h3>
<a name="assignment-11" class="anchor" href="#assignment-11"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment 11</h3>

<p>This assignment gave us practice with binary-heaps as we were required to implement the interface.</p>

<h3>
<a name="assignment-12" class="anchor" href="#assignment-12"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assignment 12</h3>

<p>This assignment made decompress and compress a file using huffman's algorithm.</p>

<h3>
<a name="extra-credit" class="anchor" href="#extra-credit"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extra Credit</h3>

<p>This extra credit assignment brushed up on multi-threading and its uses.</p>

<h3>
<a name="final-project" class="anchor" href="#final-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Final Project</h3>

<p>For our final project we had to decide our own data structures and create a random-phrase generator using a specific syntax provided.</p>
